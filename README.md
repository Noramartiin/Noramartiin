# Hello there! I'm Nora Martin

I'm a Fullstack Web Developer, Communication Specialist and Event Director from Bilbao, Spain. I'm currently working in strengthening my skills and learning new ones to create amazing projects.

**My quote is:** *'If you really want it, the time to do it is NOW'*

When I'm not developing and creating things, you can find me with my dogs, watching things on Youtube, exploring the deep worlds of Spotify to discover new songs  or debating the communication strategies that the influencers and politicians apply.

This are the things I've been lately working on:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Noramartiin/SAVE-THE-HOBBITS"> Save The Hobbits</a><br/>
This is the first game I created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Noramartiin/globalngo"> Global NGO</a><br/>
This app was created with NodeJs and Express.</li>
